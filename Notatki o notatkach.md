Zettelkasten focuses on the creation of _permanent notes._ Each note that you add to your Zettelkasten should be _**future-focused**_ , and you should be able to look back at any given note and understand the core idea. 

- Make a _**fleeting note**_ whenever you run across information that interests you. Fleeting notes are fast “**back of the napkin**” notes to remind you of an idea.
- Review your fleeting notes routinely (daily is best). As you review them, you should:
- Rewrite the note for an audience. How would you explain this concept to someone who knew nothing about it?
- Make sure a similar note doesn’t already exist in your Zettelkasten (if it does, merge this one)
- Find a related note in your Zettelkasten to link it to
- Find other similar notes and link the new note to them too

My own personal rules for creating a permanent note are something like this:

- One “big idea” per note
- Understandable without context
- Written in my own words
- Linked to other notes

**fleeting and permanent note**

I’ve gone through all the details above, but here’s a quick summary of how I do Zettelkasten in Obsidian:

- Find an idea, create a fleeting note in my “Fleeting” folder (dedicated to just fleeting notes)
- Hours or days later, go through fleeting notes. Rewrite the original idea, create new notes for new ideas if needed, and link related ideas together
- Move permanent notes out of the Fleeting folder, into my permanent notes folder
- As time goes on, connect more and more ideas to the original idea
